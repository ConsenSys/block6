# Block6 ðŸ’£ - Hacker's Night


## To Play

1) Get MetaMask setup on Rinkeby with some test ETH (Rinkeby ETH).

2) Open [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&version=soljson-v0.4.25+commit.59dbf8f1.js)
   
3) Get the Smart Contract [HERE](https://github.com/ConsenSys/block6/blob/master/contracts/Puzzel.sol) and paste into Remix

   * See [How to setup Remix for Block6](https://github.com/ConsenSys/block6/issues/1) if needed.

4) Connect Remix (with the above smart contract) to the following address: TDB
     * To do this paste the above address into the AtAddress box on Remix (see below).

5) Your good to go! 


The goal of the game is to be the first player to call the ```defuseBomb()``` method on the smart contract.

In order to call ```defuseBomb()``` you must **first** call each of the puzzle methods (```puzzle01``` - ```puzzle11```). The solutions to the puzzles will require some understanding of interacting with smart contracts, working with solidity, and smart contract security and exploits.
